# INSTRUCTIONS
- Once you launch the game, your game character (player) is initially positioned at the bottom of the game board, and your mission is to help your game character get to the top of the game board (the water region) without colliding with the enemies that are continually moving on the game board.
- Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move your game character (player) in any direction you desire.
- If your player collides with any enemy, it returns to its starting position at the bottom of the game board.
- If your player reaches the water at the top of the game board safely, you win the game.
